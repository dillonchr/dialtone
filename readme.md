# Dial tone :phone:
Not sure what I want this to become yet. But I started reading Cyberpunk last year and just bought another Phreaking book by Bruce Sterling. I'm fascinated with dial tones and want to create a numpad that makes the correct tones. Then I want to try sending dial tones to touch tone accessible numbers. KHConf seems like a fun place to start. 

## todo:
make this runnable without putting in a webbrowser manually, and get a gui :baby:
